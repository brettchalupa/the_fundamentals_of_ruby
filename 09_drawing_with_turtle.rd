Turtle is a neat little drawing tool that is part of Shoes. You can programmatically draw lines!

= Turtle

  # coderay ruby

  Turtle.draw

But I don't see anything!

= Turtle

  # coderay ruby

  Turtle.draw do
    background maroon
  end

I still don't see any turtle!

= Turtle

  # coderay ruby

  Turtle.draw do
    background orange
    pencolor honeydew
    forward 50
  end

There's a line!

Some useful Turtle commands:

  # coderay ruby

  reset         # reset turtle positon and color
  clear         # clear the screen
  forward 100   # draw forward
  backward 50   # draw backward
  turnleft 90   # turn left 90 degrees
  turnright 90  # turn right 90 degrees
  pencolor red  # set the pen color
  penup         # stop drawing
  pendown       # start drawing
  setx 10       # set the x position
  sety 30       # set the y position

Let's implement a loop with turtle

  # coderay ruby

  Turtle.draw do
    background orange
    pencolor honeydew
    4.times do
      forward 50
      turnright 90
    end
  end

Turtle moves really really fast though, let's slow it down.

Change Turtle.draw to Turtle.start and see what happens.

What can you draw with Turtle?

  # coderay ruby

  Turtle.draw do
    background orange
    pencolor honeydew
    forward 50
    turnright 90
    forward 100
  end

= Turtle

  # coderay ruby

  Turtle.start do
    background orange
    pencolor honeydew
    forward 50
  end

Try changing Turtle.draw to Turtle.start and see what happens.

= Turtle

  # coderay ruby

  Turtle.start do
    background orange
    pencolor honeydew
    forward 50
  end

Now you can walk through what happens in turtle step by step.

See what you can draw and save it to your flash drive.
  # coderay ruby

  Turtle.draw do
    background orange
    pencolor honeydew

    4.times do
      forward 50
      turnright 90
      forward 100
    end
  end
