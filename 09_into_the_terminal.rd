= The Terminal

The terminal, the shell, the command prompt. It's all the same (pretty much).

= The Terminal

OS X and Linux are powered by UNIX, which means their terminals are the same. Windows uses the Command Prompt, which is a bit different.

= The Terminal

The dollar sign, $, denotes commands run from the terminal.

If you see $ and commands, then enter whatever is after $ into the terminal.
