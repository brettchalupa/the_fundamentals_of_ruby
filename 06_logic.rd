= Logic

A large part of programming is basic logic, Yes or No.

The computer needs to be told when to amke a decision.

= Logic

Type the following into Hackety Hack:

  # coderay ruby

  alert 1 < 2
  alert 2 + 2 < 4
  alert 2 + 2 <= 4
  alert 2.even?
  alert 2.odd?
  alert 6 - 3 == 7 - 4

= Logic

Ruby uses the basic comparison operators to determine if something is true or false.

= Conditions

In the state of Vermont, you need to be 15 or older to take your driver permit test. Let's let the user know whether or not they are old enough to take the test.

= Conditions

  # coderay ruby

  age = ask "How old are you?"
  age = age.to_i

  if age > 14
    alert "You can take you driver permit test!"
  end

= Conditions

If age is greater than 14, then you can take your driver permit test. Else you are too young.

= Conditions

  # coderay ruby

  age = ask "How old are you?"
  age = age.to_i

  if age > 14
    alert "You can take you driver permit test!"
  else
    alert "You are too young."
  end

= Conditions

In how many years will they be able to take the test?

= Conditions

  # coderay ruby

  age = ask "How old are you?"
  age = age.to_i

  if age > 14
    alert "You can take you driver permit test!"
  else
    alert "You are too young."
    alert "Wait " + (15 - age.to_i).to_s + " years!"
  end

= Conditions

Use if and else with comparisons to determine what should happen!
