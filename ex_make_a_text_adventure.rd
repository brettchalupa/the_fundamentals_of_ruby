= Expanding Upon Concepts

Ideas to expand upon:

(1) Add in defence into the combat algorithm
(2) Add multiple attacks to the Player class, set them and ask for user input when attacking
(3) Add speed or initiative to the Player and Enemy class to determine who attacks first
(4) Add a healing spell (and MP or mana) to the player to let them heal
(5) Add an items array that keeps track of the different items a player may have
(6) Skill points
(7) User input before combat
