= The Most Basic Data Types

* Objects
* Strings
* Numbers

= Objects

Everything in Ruby is an object. Object is the most base "class" of everything in Ruby.

= Strings

Strings are like words. They are always between quotes. Don't forget the quotes!

  # coderay ruby

  "Hello Ruby!"

= Numbers

Fixnums (Integers)

Fixed numbers are whole numbers - no decimals!

  # coderay ruby

  5091

Floats

  # coderay ruby

  50.5

# = Booleans

# TODO

= Exercise: Alert Strings and Numbers

In Hackety Hack, try running:

  # coderay ruby

  alert 10
  alert 10.class
  alert "Hello Ruby!"
  alert "Hello Ruby!".class

= Manipulating Data Types

Math! Now you are using a very expensive calculator.

Try to add some numbers together.

  # coderay ruby

  alert 10 + 3
  alert 45 - 12
  alert 2 + 6.2

= Manipulating Data Types

Great, let's see if you can add strings together.

  # coderay ruby

  alert "Hello" + "Ruby" + "!"
  alert 47 + 802
  alert 2 + 6.2

= Manipulating Data Types

Do you think you can add a number and a string together?

= Manipulating Data Types

Let's give it a try!

  # coderay ruby

  alert "Hello" + 10

= Manipulating Data Types

Hmm...nothing popped up.

What does this mean?

= Errors

It must mean something went wrong! An error is a **usually** useful message that lets you know what went wrong.

= Errors

Let's check the error log ("Command + /" or Help > Console).

= Errors

Now let's dissect this error and see what it means.

(1) Take a deep breathe
(2) Read the error message out loud
(3) Look up the definition of any of the words you don't know
